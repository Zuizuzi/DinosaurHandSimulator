# DinosaurHandSimulator
A Script to generate sample hands and test for available combos
Notes: The algorithm is very dumb and greedy and will prioritize picking Giant Rex from Pot of Prosperity over good Hand Traps, just to make Dolkka earlier.
In general: The algorith always uses Pot of Prosperity and then uses all the Fossil Digs it has. At each of these junctures it will try all available options.
